Grubby Discards

These are the features that were considered but rejected for one reason or another.

all( filter )
    The all modifier is necessary but it cannot take a filter argument.
    Allowing people to put a filter in the all modifier may encourage it to be used more generally, which defeats the purpose.
    This modifier should only be used when a bulk update or delete is truly needed--a rarity.

A filter cannot be an array of primary key values.
    It can either be a single primary key value or an associative array of matched equalities.
    Allowing arrays of primary key values was removed because it's confusing.
    Example: $table->filter(array(1, 42, 420))

notExpression(expression [, wildcard(s)])
    The not expression is unnecessary because filter expressions can be negative expressions without adding the confusing extra negative.

Create on duplicate Update. Example: $table->createUpdate($create_array, $update_array);  // one or other
    This overcomplicates the library. Look into databases that support this feature. Look for an elegant way to support it.
